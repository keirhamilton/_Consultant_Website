          <div class="card-body"><p>My name is Keir Hamilton and I am currently a senior crop consultant in the State of California. Before becoming a consultant, I received a Doctorate in Plant Medicine (DPM) a Master’s of Science in Horticultural Sciences with a concentration in Environmental Horticulture, and a Bachelor’s of Science in Environmental Science and Policy. My multidisciplinary education and years of public-private research experiences and management permitted me to pragmatically analyze, interpret and apply rules and regulations from the USDA-AMS-National Organic Program in the State of Florida.</p>
	  <p>As a young scientist, I was investigated questions that I pondered as a child. For example, I was always curious about agriculture in Florida and why certain crops like lettuce bolted in warm Florida weather, whereas others thrived. Furthermore, I was always curious as to why some of my favorite fruits and vegetables were more expensive than others. As a graduate student researcher, I discovered and applied the policies and agricultural practices that make fruits and vegetables a sustainable practice for all.</p>
	  <p>In the future, I look forward to using my skills (e.g., Agricultural science, horticulture, entomology, plant pathology, environmental science and policy) to make fruits and vegetables more affordable/ attainable to those who are less fortunate.</p></div>
